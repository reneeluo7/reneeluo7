### I am Full-Stack Software Engineer 

HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Renee, a full-stack software engineer with experience in React, Redux, Javascript, Python, Flask, Express, SQL, SQLite. I have a background in nursing, master in Gerontology due to my strong compassion and empathy to those vulnerable people. I worked as nurse, social worker, which trained my communication skills and then became a program director. Working as a director developed my leadership skills, enhanced my problem-solving, how to breakdown a problem and find out the critical part as well as assign to the right team member to solve the issue. That journey guided me to become a Software Engineer. 

I completed the curriculum at App Academy, a 24-week bootcamp that is highly intensive and requires efficient and quick learning. Building an application from scratch is a rewarding thing for me. I love to create new things and solve all kinds of problems. I keep myself constantly growing and I am continue working on perfecting my skills as a Software Engineer. I have a passion to let technology benefit all vulnerable population.
